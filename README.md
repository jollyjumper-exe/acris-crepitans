## About ZOOP

Hey there!
ZOOP is a small Unity weekend project, built mainly to demonstrate and solidify my general Unity skillset. It's not super deep, but it gets the point across â€” I'm comfortable with the engine and know how to make it do what I want.

Feel free to check it out, and if youâ€™ve got any questions, just reach out. I might even answer. ðŸ˜‰
